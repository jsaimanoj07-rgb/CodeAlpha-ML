# TriVerse AI
### Enterprise AI Benchmarking & Experiment Management Platform

TriVerse AI is an enterprise-grade, modular monorepo platform designed for local-first Machine Learning operations, benchmarking, and experiment tracking. It serves as the master platform powering three high-impact AI/ML projects submitted for CodeAlpha evaluation.

---

## Architecture Overview
The platform uses a unified multi-app design linked via shared libraries, a central FastAPI backend, and an interactive Vite-based dashboard.

## Core Features & Engines

### 1. Dashboards
A beautiful, responsive glassmorphism control panel with live metrics, system utilization, dataset quality scoring, and training progression charts.

### 2. MLflow Tracking
Seamlessly logs every hyperparameter tuning trial, model training run, learning curves, and model weights to a local MLflow Tracking Server.

### 3. Optuna Hyperparameter Optimization
Enables automated Bayesian optimization directly from the UI. Run Optuna engines to search optimal learning rates, tree depths, and neural layer configurations.

### 4. Explainable AI (SHAP & LIME)
Demystifies model predictions by generating SHAP force plots and LIME feature attribution charts directly in the web browser. 

### 5. AI Assistant & Digital Twin
An interactive chat assistant powered by Ollama and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over project documents. The Digital Twin simulates data drift and stress-tests models against anomaly scenarios.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Windows OS (Runs on Nvidia RTX GPUs for optimized DL training)
- **Miniconda** / **Anaconda** (Conda environment: `dgpu-core` with Python 3.11)
- **Node.js** 18+
- **Ollama** (running locally with `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b` or similar)

### Startup Instructions
Simply run the platform using the automated startup scripts:

1. **Double-click** `start.bat` (launches standard terminal logs for MLflow, FastAPI, and Next.js frontend).
2. Or use `launcher.vbs` (runs backend services silently and automatically launches the app wrapper).

Access endpoints:
- **Frontend Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **FastAPI API Docs**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- **MLflow Tracker UI**: `http://localhost:5000`
